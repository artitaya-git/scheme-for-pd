S4PD Notes 

BETA TODO:
- cancel-delay
- clear-delays
- log messages - log null and log console
- add scheduling tab to help
- finish logging tab


FEATURES
- i/o of all the data types
- eval off message
- eval string
- loading from file path
- loading not from path - use "load"
- resetting interpreter
- write and read single points to tables
- scheduling - working 
  - need to clean clocks out during reset though...
- send message to a receiver
- ? repeating clock ? 


TODO
- reset message
  - it will need to free out the scheduler and shit
- put functions on the scheduler
- D read and write to arrays
- switch error handling to pd_error

FIGURE OUT:
- all those warnings!!

FUTURE
- allow list output to ouput strings - ie don't cast strings to symbols necessarily
- get paren symbol input working using binbuf concatenation

BUGS:
- crash when trying to send a vector: (send 'my-num #(1 2 3))
- loading bad file on startup doesn't show that it didn't work

DONE
- equivalent of load-from-max
- post output
- list and vector output
- basic atom_to_s7 (no dict recursion)
- basic s7_to_atom
- input of messages to s7 list
- paren'd code input from messages with |fudi -u| -> |list to symbol|
- D send messages

BETA 1
- DONE? do input and output
- DONE be able to read files, including nested loads - just works!
- D run scheme messages from pd messages - works for no-parens messages
- reset interpreter
- D post command
- list output not done yet

ISSUE:
- casting from ints to floats is going to be hard to work around
- back tick commas?

DIFFERENT 
- there is no prelude file, might not even need one
- post should just take all it's args, convert them to strings, concat, and print

IN PROGRESS
- list output - working except strings are cast to symbols
  - not sure what it should be, symbols with quotes around them??

For file loading:
EXTERN int open_via_path(const char *dir, const char *name, const char *ext,
    char *dirresult, char **nameresult, unsigned int size, int bin);
- need to make a load from pd function with that chrome
- see example in m_binbuf.c line 888

IN PROGRESS:
- got delay working
- need to implement cancel_delay and add clock cleanup to the reset function
  - get all clocks I guess?
