# scheme-for-pd
Scheme for PD will be a PureData port of the Scheme For Max external, providing an embedded S7 Scheme interpreter for scripting and live coding PureData in Scheme Lisp. 

This repository is here prior to anything going in it so that people who are interested can watch it to get release announcements. Development should pick up in 2021 now that Scheme For Max 0.2 is complete.
