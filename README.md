# scheme-for-pd
Scheme for PD will be a PureData port of the Scheme For Max external, providing an embedded S7 Scheme interpreter for scripting and live coding PureData in Scheme Lisp. 

This repository is here prior to anything going in it so that people who are interested can watch it to get release announcements. 

News as of 2021-03: I have development of this approved for my Master's thesis at UVic, and so will be doing it in earnest from May 2021 on. I was hoping to have it moving already, but program requirements had other ideas. :-)
